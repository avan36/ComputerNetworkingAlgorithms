# Computer Networking Algorithms
 Each file with a unique number is meant to be run independently.

1. The distance vector code ([link](https://github.com/avan36/ComputerNetworkingAlgorithms/blob/1df12c7cacabb63364fecb95773043c86717c844/1.distance_vector_algorithm(run_on_each_router).py)) is my implementation of the distance vector algorithm in computer networks 

2. Network traceroute ([link](https://github.com/avan36/ComputerNetworkingAlgorithms/blob/1df12c7cacabb63364fecb95773043c86717c844/2.network_traceroute_application.py))
This code is an implementation of traceroute for use in linux since it usees raw sockets, which is not possible for MacOS or Windows

3. Ping application ([client code](https://github.com/avan36/ComputerNetworkingAlgorithms/blob/1df12c7cacabb63364fecb95773043c86717c844/3.ping_application_over_udp_client.py), [server code](https://github.com/avan36/ComputerNetworkingAlgorithms/blob/1df12c7cacabb63364fecb95773043c86717c844/3.ping_application_over_udp_server.py))
Both the ping application client and ping application server are meant to be run at the same time in a terminal. The server should be running first and then the client code should run.
